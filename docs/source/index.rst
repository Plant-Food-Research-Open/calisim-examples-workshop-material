calisim is an open-source, low-code model calibration library that streamlines and standardises your workflows, while aiming to be as flexible and extensible as needed to support more complex use-cases. Using calisim will speed up your experiment cycle substantially and make you more productive.

calisim is primarily a wrapper around popular libraries and frameworks including Optuna, PyMC, scikit-learn, and emcee among many others. The design and simplicity of calisim was inspired by the scikit-learn and PyCaret libraries.

Features and Functionality
--------------------------

* A standardised and streamlined interface to multiple calibration procedures and libraries.
* A low-code library, allowing modellers to rapidly construct multiple workflows for many calibration procedures.
* An object-oriented programming architecture, allowing users to easily extend and modify calibration workflows for their own complex modelling use-cases.
* An unopinionated approach to working with simulation models, allowing users to calibrate both Python-based and non-Python-based models.
* Optional integration with PyTorch for access to more sophisticated Gaussian Process and deep learning surrogate models, state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, and deep generative modelling for simulation-based inference.
