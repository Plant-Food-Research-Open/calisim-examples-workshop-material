Workshop Introduction
=====================

*Introduction to the calisim Python package for the calibration of computer simulation models. Demonstrates model calibration and evaluation procedures such as black-box optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian calibration.*

Overview
--------

Workshop material for calisim may be found in the `workshop directory <https://github.com/Plant-Food-Research-Open/calisim-examples-workshop-material/tree/main/workshops>`_.

We will work though basic examples for optimisation and sensitivity analysis, alongside more complex calibration methods.
